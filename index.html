            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an ML Engineer specializing in the end-to-end development and deployment of computer vision systems. I have a proven ability to architect robust AI/ML pipelines, containerize models for scalable inference via APIs, and integrate ethical considerations and explainability into the core of a project. I am passionate about building responsible and transparent AI solutions and am actively seeking an internship or full-time ML Engineer role where I can contribute to building transparent and impactful solutions.
